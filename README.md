# Notice: Maintained Fork of Tabliss

This repository was originally the main development hub for Tabliss, a beautiful and customizable new tab page for Firefox and Chrome. However, the project has been abandoned, with no updates for over a year and numerous pull requests left unmerged.

## Why This Fork?

I cloned the repository and implemented several of the  pull requests to bring in  improvements and bug fixes. Moving forward, I will be maintaining and updating this fork to keep Tabliss functional and up to date.

## What's Next?

- Continued updates and bug fixes.
- Adding new features from community contributions.
- Keeping dependencies up to date.

If you were a contributor to the original repo or have ideas for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's keep Tabliss alive!
