# TablissNG - A Maintained Fork of the Beautiful New Tab Extension

> **Important**: This is a maintained fork of the original Tabliss project, which was abandoned. I've cloned the repository, merged all existing pull requests, and am actively maintaining it with bug fixes and new features. The original extension is no longer maintained, but this fork keeps Tabliss alive and improving! Github page: <https://github.com/BookCatKid/TablissNG>
